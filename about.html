        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
         Hi, my nickname is Masg685 and I'm from Australia. I was born on the island of Savai'i in Samoa.
         In 2023, I started playing Emergency Hamburg, a roleplay game from Germany. I've earned over 300,000 XP as a police officer, which is known as one of the best teams in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later, I started creating content on social media — beginning with YouTube and then expanding to TikTok.

         I will be creating a <a href="private-server.html" class="about-link">private-server</a></p> in Emergency Hamburg, and once controller support is added in the next update.
