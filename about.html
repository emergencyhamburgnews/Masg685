        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
         Hi, my nickname is Masg685 and I'm from Australia. I was born on the island of Savai'i in Samoa.
         In 2023, I started playing Emergency Hamburg, a roleplay game from Germany. I've earned over 300,000 XP as a police officer, which is known as one of the best teams in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later, I started creating content on social media — beginning with YouTube and then expanding to TikTok.

        <p>The first gang I joined in Emergency Hamburg was called VTS, which stands for Vatos. We all wore red shirts, and that's why all my cars are red. Red is also my favorite color.</p>
        <h1>Which gang am I currently part of?:</h1>
        <p>The gang I'm currently in is called FSR, which stands for Frozen Storm Raiders, created by <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/5458763793/profile" class="about-link">Acrxzz</a></p> I've been a member since 08/05/2025.
